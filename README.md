It is very common nowadays for a business to make use of a Tag Manager such as Google Tag Manager or Tealium. Tag managers allow you to record customer events from your mobile and web applications and share them with other platforms that require these events e.g. Google Campaign Manager or Facebook Ads. Before tag managers, if a new platform required to ingest behavioural events, businesses needed to hardcode its pixel on their web/mobile app.
